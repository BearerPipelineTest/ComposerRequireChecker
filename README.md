# ComposerRequireChecker

A CLI tool to analyze composer dependencies and verify that no unknown symbols are used in the sources of a package.
This will prevent you from using "soft" dependencies that are not defined within your `composer.json` require section.

## Installation / Usage

Composer require checker is not supposed to be installed as part of your project dependencies.
  
### PHAR file [preferred]

Please check the [releases](https://github.com/maglnet/ComposerRequireChecker/releases) for available phar files.
Download the latest release and and run it like this:
```
php composer-require-checker.phar check /path/to/your/project/composer.json
```

### PHIVE

If you already use [PHIVE](https://phar.io/)  to install and manage your projectâ€™s tooling, then you should be able to simply install ComposerRequireChecker like this:

```
phive install composer-require-checker
``` 

### Composer - global command

This package can be easily globally installed by using [Composer]:

```sh
composer global require maglnet/composer-require-checker
```

If you haven't already setup you composer installation to support global requirements, please refer to the [Composer cli - global]
If this is already done, run it like this:

```
composer-require-checker check /path/to/your/project/composer.json
```

## Configuration

Composer require checker is configured to whitelist some symbols per default. Have a look at the
[config file example](data/config.dist.json) to see which configuration options are available.

You can now adjust this file, as needed, and tell composer-require-checker to use it for it's configuration.

```sh
bin/composer-require-checker check --config-file=path/to/config.json /path/to/your/project/composer.json
``` 

### Scan Additional Files

To scan files, that are not part of your autoload definition you may add glob patterns to the config file's `scan-files`
section.

The following example would also scan the file `bin/console` and all files with `.php` extension within your `bin/` folder:

```
"scan-files" : ["bin/console", "bin/*.php"]
```
